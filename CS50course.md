#### Description: video game in Lua via LOVE2D framework

##### Introduction: For my final project, I decided to create a little game in Lua via the LOVE2D framework. I had to teach myself how to write in Lua language. I did so through a great step-by-step tutorial on Sheepolution's "How to Love." I went through all the chapters and practiced everything that was there. In the final chapter "Platformer," I created a simple platformer game demo – simple, but with all the important mechanics like collision detection/resolution, gravity, animations, classes, and so on. So this final chapter was a stepping stone into my own game...
##### Deciding on Basic Concept: I was deciding on the basic parameters of my game for a long time. I wasn't sure if I wanted a game from a top-down perspective, something in the style of io games, or a slightly more challenging thing – a platformer. I decided on the latter because I thought it would bring out more features and possibilities than a top-down game. So many things "work" in a game: you can run as you wish, jump, gravity pulls you down, you stay on platforms (if you don't actually fall off them), you can jump over obstacles or enemies, you can pick up objects. There's quite a neat visual look to the game (I downloaded free tile sets and textures for characters, objects, and also the background... all in a cyberpunk style).
##### development phase: so as I mentioned I have started building my game on top of the code from final chapter "How to Love". I have added another types of objects like card, chest. I have also added another "player" like entity enemy. I had to modifie few things in all the files eg. in player.lua i have added shake animation, animation of a player itself (i have also animated few objects in a game and enemy). In main.lua i had to make a function for having a tilemap outside of sourcecode in .csv file which in turn I could simply open in Excel and modify comfortablly all there. I have added time-counter for situations when I wanted to draw on frames some text for some time. I have added audio, basic gamestates, rolling layered background etc.
##### obsticles: I have found pretty difficult to change anythinh in "resolve collision logic" functions coming from "How to Love". I wanted to use checkcollision function not only to have it generally resolve collision but also for specific cases when eg. player and card collide, card should be destroyed etc. but I could not make that happen even with many hours of typing with chatGPT4. for a side note: He always tried something but made it even more complex and it never worked and sometime it broke so far functioning code... in a way that thing started to diseapear in a game. Because for some reason there was always initial collision reported with a player in first frame even though all the objects should have been very far in x,y from themselfs.... So I made i workaround. I made function (which i actually learnt in "How to love") that was counting the distance betwen particular object and player and when the distance got too small eg. 30 px, than it was a trggier point via if statemets to make object diseapear or player to "be killed" (have him 0 health... which for turn was a condition for end game state). Most of the time I think I have spent on animations and unsuccesfully trying to modife resolve collision function. Other than that thigs were easy... just maybe deciding on scope of the game was also a challenge, It took some time that I definitely decided how the level will look like, how big is gonna be and what feauters are gonna be in a game.
